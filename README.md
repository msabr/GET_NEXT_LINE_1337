# **get_next_line - 42 Network**  

## **Overview**  
Reading content **line by line** is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks, whether dealing with **files, standard input (stdin), or network connections**. The **get_next_line** project challenges you to create a function that efficiently reads and returns one line at a time from a given file descriptor. This function will be a crucial tool for future projects.  

## **Project Scope**  
In this project, you will:  

- Implement a function that reads and returns a single line from a **file descriptor**.  
- Manage **buffered reading** efficiently to optimize performance.  
- Handle **multiple file descriptors** simultaneously.  
- Properly manage **memory allocation** and **freeing** to avoid leaks.  

## **Learning Outcomes**  
- Deepening knowledge of **file handling** and **buffer management** in C.  
- Understanding and working with **static variables**.  
- Improving skills in **memory management** (allocating, freeing, and avoiding leaks).  
- Gaining experience with **edge cases** (empty files, newlines, large files, etc.).  

## **Usage**  
To compile and use **get_next_line**, run:  

```sh
make
